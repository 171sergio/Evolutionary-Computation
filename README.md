# Evolutionary-Computation

This project simulates organisms with genetic traits that influence their movement, food searching, reproduction, and survival. Each organism has its own DNA, which affects speed, perception, and size. The simulation includes mutation and natural selection.

Features
Genetics (DNA): Organisms have traits like speed, perception, and size that influence their behavior.
Health: Organisms lose health as they move and must find food to survive.
Reproduction: Organisms of opposite sexes reproduce if they are close and healthy enough, passing on mixed DNA to offspring with possible mutations.
Sex Determination: Based on genetic factors, organisms are male (1) or female (0).
Death: When health reaches zero, organisms die and are removed.
